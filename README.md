# Social Media - Python

This is a simple social media program developed solo for a school project (using OOP). The program is built in Python and is designed to provide users with basic social media features listed below!
It's a little rough on the edges, but I still consider it a bit of solid work that I'm proud of.

***Features:***
User Registration: Users can create an account with a username and password.
- Post Messages: Users can write and post text/image messages.
- Login & Authentication: login system to access your account or create a new one.
- Friending system
